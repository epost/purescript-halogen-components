halogen-components
==================

I am attempting to teach myself purescript-halogen and to weigh up the pros and cons of using it instead of Pux.  This module consists of a set of isolated UI components, chosen because they have been the predominant GUI pieces within Pux modules .  Currently we have:

  * File input select
  * Multiple select dropdown
  * Soundfont melody player

to build each example
---------------------

   cd to the example

   bower install

   npm run build

   and then navigate to /dist/index.html
